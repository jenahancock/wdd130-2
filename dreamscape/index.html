  <h2>Why People Visit Dreamscape</h2>
  <p>
    People visit my site to explore creative design options and see examples of
    what I can create for their business or organization. Many are small
    business owners, schools, or community groups who need professional, clean
    design work that still feels approachable and personal. My site helps answer
    questions like: What kind of design work do you do? What does your style
    look like? How can I hire you or start a project?
  </p>

  <h3>What Sets Dreamscape Apart</h3>
  <p>
    Dreamscape Graphic Design stands out through a balance of creativity,
    professionalism, and personalization. I take time to understand each
    client’s story and the personality behind their brand so the designs feel
    like a natural extension of who they are. My goal is not just to make
    something that looks good, but to create visuals that feel right,
    communicate clearly, and help clients feel confident sharing their message.
