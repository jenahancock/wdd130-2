      <h3>Inspiration and Style</h3>
      <p>
        Each project in my portfolio reflects a blend of structure and imagination.
        I’m inspired by clean layouts, thoughtful typography, and color palettes
        that support the message instead of distracting from it. Some designs are
        bold and bright, while others are more minimal and calm, but they all share
        the same goal: to make information easy to understand and visually engaging
        for the people who see it.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Design Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Design is often the first impression someone has of a brand or message. It
        shapes how people feel, what they remember, and whether they trust what
        they see. Thoughtful design can help a small business look polished and
        professional, make complex information easier to absorb, and create a sense
        of connection with an audience. Through Dreamscape, I want to show how good
        design can support real-world goals—not just look pretty on the page.
